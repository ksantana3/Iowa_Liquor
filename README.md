# Iowa_Liquor

This is the 3rd Project 3 from Data Science Immersive at General Assembly and we will be working with the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset. 

## Problem

A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations. The business owner is interested in the details of the best model you can fit to the data so that his team can evaluate potential locations for a new storefront.
